# Project-2-First-Draft
First Draft of Project 2
The "Project 2C" file is my first draft of my Project 2 assignment

The "primates.fasta" file contains 9 different primate fasta sequences sourced from UniProt.

My scientific question is: Is there a significant difference between the DNA binding domain of P53 genes of humans and the P53 DNA binding domains of other primates, and how do changes to P53 result in changes to the lifespan and health of different species?

My scientific hypothesis is: If the human P53 gene is unique in protecting the human body from developing cancer as a tumor suppressor, then because the P53 gene exists in other primates, they should all have similar characteristics to one another, whether that be through sequence or structure. Additionally, if P53 has any effects on health, then longer lifespans and can be used as an indicator for the effectiveness of different P53 DNA binding domains on overall health.
